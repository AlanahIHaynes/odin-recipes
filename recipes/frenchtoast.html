        <li>8 Large Slices Bread</li>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup Whole Milk</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, whish eggs, milk, vanilla, sugar, cinnamon,
            and a pinch of salt until fully combined.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat your skillet over medium-low heat. Melt the butter in the pan.</li>
        <li>Dip a slice of bread into the egg mixture, allowing a few seconds for 
            the egg to soak into the bread. Flip the bread over and repeat on the other side.
        </li>
        <li>Place the bread in the pan and cook over medium-low heat until cooked through.
            This will take about 4 minutes per side.
